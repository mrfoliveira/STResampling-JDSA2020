\usage{
simple_workflow(
  train,
  test,
  form,
  model,
  time,
  site_id,
  resample.pars = NULL,
  handleNAs = "centralImputNAs",

}
\arguments{
\item{train}{a data frame for training}

\item{test}{a data frame for testing}

\item{form}{a formula describing the model to learn}

\item{model}{the name of the algorithm to use}

\item{time}{the name of the column in \code{train} and
\code{test} containing time-stamps}

\item{site_id}{the name of the column in \code{train} and
\code{test} containing location IDs}

\item{resample.pars}{parameters to be passed to re-sample function.
Default is NULL.}

\item{handleNAs}{string indicating how to deal with NAs.
If "centralImputNAs", training observations with at least 80\%
of non-NA columns, will have their NAs substituted by the mean
value and testing observatiosn will have their NAs filled in with
mean value regardless. Default is NULL.}

\item{min_train}{a minimum number of observations that must be
left to train a model. If there are not enough observations, 
predictions will be \code{NA}. Default is 2.}

\item{nORp}{a maximum number or fraction of columns/rows with missing
values above which a row/column will be removed from train before 
learning the model. Only works if \code{handleNAs} was
set to centralImputNAs. Default is 0.2.}

\item{...}{other parameters to feed to \code{model}}
}
\value{
a data frame containing time-stamps, location IDs,
true values and predicted values
}
\description{
A simple learning and prediction workflow that may deal
with NAs and use re-sampling techniques to balance an
imbalanced regression problem.
